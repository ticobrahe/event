Planning on catering food & serving drinks (Alcohol/Non-Alcohol), hiring a DJ and renting some tables? Depending on the size of your part/event, you might want to add security to that list.<br>
                      Having a security presence at your party will not only help to make your event a prestigious one but also help maintain a safe environment for you and your guests as well as protect your property.<span style="float: right; "><a href="/eventsecurity-form">Book Now</a></span></p><br><p>
                      <div style="color: green" class="h4"><strong>Prices for hiring a security guard for a private/corporate event can vary. Some details that factor into the cost includes:</strong></div>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <strong>Quality of guards:</strong> Experience, Background and even Costume all factor into the pricing of a guard. If you want an off duty police officer or a guard with a military background, it’s going to cost a little more. If you are looking to keep the price to a minimum, consider that the security Company sending the guard will probably be paying the guard minimum wage. The guard that you should want for your event should have fair amount of experience, present themselves in a professional manner and have effective communication skills in the case of a disturbance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <strong>Independent guard Vs Security Company:</strong>  Many independent guards might cost less; however many times they don’t have liability insurance and sometimes don’t even have a license to perform security guard services. If the guard or one of your guests is hurt, or there is an incident during your party, you run the risk of having a law suit on your hands. Your best bet is to hire a security guard through a licensed and insured company.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <strong>
                      Armed VS Unarmed guards:</strong>  Unless your party is being thrown in a dicey area of town or you are going to have high profile guests, you probably won’t need an armed guard. Armed guards add to your cost due to the high risk of liability.
